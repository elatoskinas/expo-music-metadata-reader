# expo-music-metadata-reader

Discontinued Expo Music Metadata Reader module. The intention of the module was to provide an API to pass in [Expo Asset URIs](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/asset/) and retrieve audio metadata. Currently, a simple implementation was done for the Android module. The module is currently discontinued in favour of choosing native app solutions instead of Expo.
